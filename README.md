This repository contains the final project for parallel computing course.

## Run
To execute the code you need to:
1. Create a folder named "input"
2. Insert an image inside input folder
3. Compile and execute the program specifying the image name like
```
LBPSequential img.jpg
```
At the end of the run an output folder with histogram will be generated.

## Other versions
This implementation of k-means algorithm is intended for execution time comparison wrt 
[CUDA version](https://github.com/daikon899/LBP_CUDA) and 
[OpenMP version](https://github.com/daikon899/LBP_OpenMP)
